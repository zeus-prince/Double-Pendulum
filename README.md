# Double Pendulum



A double pendulum consists of one pendulum attached to another. Double pendulum is an example of a simple physical system which can exhibit chaotic behavior. For large motions it is a chaotic system, but for small motions it is a simple linear system. That is for small angles it behaves like a simple pendulum, but for large angles it exhibits a complex and chaotic motion, yet the motion is governed by a set of ordinary differential equations. Let's look at the derivation of this system and visualize it.

### ASSUMPTIONS :
+ Consider a double bob pendulum with masses  and  attached by rigid massless wires of lengths l1 and l2.
+ Let the angles made by the pendulum with the vertical axis be q1 and q2
